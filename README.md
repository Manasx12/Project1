🏏 IPL Analytics Dashboard: Comprehensive Match & Performance Insights
An interactive sports analytics dashboard built using Power BI to analyze Indian Premier League (IPL) data across multiple seasons—uncovering trends in team performance, scoring patterns, toss decisions, venues, and match outcomes.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The IPL Analytics Dashboard is a data visualization and exploratory analytics project designed to analyze historical IPL match and ball-by-ball data. It helps users understand season-wise trends, team dominance, scoring behavior, and strategic factors such as toss decisions and venue impact, enabling data-driven insights in the domain of sports analytics.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **📊 Power BI Desktop**  
  Primary platform for building interactive dashboards and analytical reports.

- **📂 Power Query**  
  Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing of raw datasets.

- **🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
  Created calculated measures such as total runs, wickets, averages, win margins, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

- **🧩 Data Modeling**  
  Designed and managed relationships between matches and deliveries datasets for accurate analysis.

- **📁 Data Format**  
  Data sourced from CSV / Excel files (`matches.xlsx`, `deliveries.xlsx`).

- **🖼 Dashboard Output**  
  Final deliverables include a `.pbix` Power BI report file and a `.png` dashboard snapshot.


## 4. 📊 Data Source

- **Source**  
  IPL Historical Match Data.

- **📂 Matches Dataset**  
  Contains match-level information such as season, teams, toss details, venue, match result, and winning team.

- **⚾ Deliveries Dataset**  
  Ball-by-ball data capturing runs scored, wickets taken, batsmen, bowlers, dismissals, and extras.

- **🔍 Data Usage**  
  Together, these datasets enable both high-level season-wise analysis and granular player-level insights across multiple IPL seasons.

6. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
IPL generates massive volumes of match and performance data every season. However, raw data alone makes it difficult to answer strategic questions such as:
How have scoring patterns evolved over seasons?
Does winning the toss significantly influence match outcomes?
Which teams and venues consistently perform better?
What are the dominant win patterns—by runs or by wickets?
Without an interactive analytical tool, extracting these insights becomes time-consuming and inefficient.

• Goal of the Dashboard

The primary goal of this dashboard is to:
Provide a centralized visual analytics platform for IPL data
Enable season-wise, venue-wise, and team-wise exploration
Identify patterns, trends, and strategic factors influencing match results
Support sports analytics, decision-making, and storytelling through data
